title: Sign Users in to Your Mobile App
---
This guide assumes you are building a mobile app. The [Sign users in to your mobile app] guide shows how to sign users in by opening a browser. This guide shows how to build a customized sign-in experience inside your application.

<!-- If browser sign-in works for your application, we recommend using that. Building custom sign-in UI takes more effort and development time. -->

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. (Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).)
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an existing app, or are new to building apps, start with this documentation:
