Our Sign users in to your mobile app guide covers connecting your mobile app to Okta and signing users in by opening a browser. Some developers don't want to leave the app, so they want to build a custom sign-in UI with native controls and screens instead.

This guide will include code samples in the following stacks:
- iOS (Swift)
- Android (Java)

This guide will not cover password reset, account recovery, or multifactor prompts. In the future, we will either expand this guide or write new ones to cover these scenarios.
